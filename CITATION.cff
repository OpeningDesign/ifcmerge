      description: PDF of Native IFC Whitepaper
  abstract: >-
    A simple to implement set of protocols for reading and
    writing BIM data, known as Native IFC, enables robust
    multi-user collaborative BIM workflows. We show how full
    version tracking, rollback, attribution, staging, merging,
    multi-user editing, issue tracking, automated checking,
    and publishing can be achieved by hosting IFC data in
    established commercial and open source git-forge services.
    We show that the git revision control system as a Common
    Data Environment (CDE) for BIM data is scalable, secure,
    future-proof and fully interoperable with existing
    systems. We show multiple software applications and
    libraries that already implement Native IFC, this is a
    real-world technology.
